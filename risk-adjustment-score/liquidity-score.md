# Liquidity Score

The Liquidity Score is determined through the 24 hour trading volume divided by the total liquidity&#x20;

Liquidity score= 1âˆ’(A/B)

Where&#x20;

A is the 24 Hour trading volume&#x20;

B is the Total Liquidity&#x20;

* Normalized between 0 and 1, where a lower ratio of volume to market cap indicates higher liquidity change thus lower risk.
