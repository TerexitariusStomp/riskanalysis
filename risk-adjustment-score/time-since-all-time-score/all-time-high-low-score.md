# All Time High/ Low Score

The "All Time Score" formula assesses how recently a token hit either its all-time high or low, relative to a 5-year period. This score helps gauge whether the token is currently near its extremes in price, which could indicate volatility or stability.

All Time Score= A/B

Where A is The Number of Days Since an All Time Low or High

B is The Number of Days in 5 years

A **higher All Time Score** (closer to 1) means that it has been a long time since the token reached its all-time low or high, suggesting more price stability over time.

A **lower All Time Score** (closer to 0) indicates that the token hit its all-time low or high more recently, which could suggest recent volatility and potential price instability.
