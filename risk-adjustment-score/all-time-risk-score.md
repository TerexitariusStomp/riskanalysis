# All-Time Risk Score

The "All Time Risk Score" is a simple ratio that measures the risk of a token by comparing its lowest and highest prices over its entire history. This score provides a sense of how much a token's price has fluctuated since it started trading, helping to assess its long-term volatility and potential risk.

All Time Risk Score=A/B

Where

A is the All Time Low

B is the All Time High

A score closer to **1** indicates that the token's price has been relatively stable between its highest and lowest points, suggesting lower historical risk and volatility.

A score closer to **0** indicates a large difference between the all-time low and all-time high, suggesting that the token has experienced significant price swings, which can be a sign of higher risk. This volatility may make the token less suitable for stable collateral.
