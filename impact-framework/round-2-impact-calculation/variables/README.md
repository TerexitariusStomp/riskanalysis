# Variables

Azos employs a comprehensive framework for evaluating and ranking actions based on their impact across various dimensions. This framework allows for a holistic assessment of different initiatives, technologies, or projects.

To create an effective ranking system for solutions, these variables can be normalized, weighted according to strategic energy priorities, and combined into a composite impact score. The resulting ranking can guide decision-makers in prioritizing initiatives with the greatest potential for positive change, while also allowing for dynamic updates as technologies evolve and new data becomes available. Ultimately, it ensures that Azos efforts are directed towards the most impactful solutions.
