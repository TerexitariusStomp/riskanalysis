# Groupings

The groupings presented represent key areas of focus in environmental impact and climate change mitigation efforts. Here's a concise overview of the main groupings:

### Energy

Encompasses various methods of energy production and generation. It focuses on both renewable and non-renewable sources, with an emphasis on cleaner alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. The energy sector plays a crucial role in the transition to a low-carbon economy and is central to many climate change mitigation strategies.

### Efficiency

Concentrates on optimizing resource use across different sectors of the economy. This category aims to reduce waste, minimize energy consumption, and improve the overall productivity of various processes. Efficiency measures are often seen as a cost-effective way to reduce environmental impact while potentially offering economic benefits.

### Ecosystem Management

Focuses on the restoration, conservation, and sustainable management of natural ecosystems. It recognizes the vital role that healthy ecosystems play in maintaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and providing essential services.

### Carbon Capture

Targets the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This grouping includes both natural and technological approaches to sequestering carbon. As global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensify, carbon capture strategies are increasingly seen as a necessary component of comprehensive climate action plans.
