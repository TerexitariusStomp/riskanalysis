# Resource Efficiency

## Construction

Construction refers to the processes involved in building structures, from residential homes to large-scale infrastructure projects. Sustainable construction aims to reduce the environmental impact of buildings throughout their lifecycle, from construction to operation and eventual demolition.

### Recycling

Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new products or raw materials. Recycling encompasses various materials including paper, plastic, glass, metals, and electronics. It involves collection, sorting, processing, and remanufacturing stages. Effective recycling programs require public participation, efficient collection systems, and markets for recycled materials.

### Manufacturing

Manufacturing involves the production of goods on a large scale, typically using machinery and industrial processes. Efficient manufacturing aims to produce goods with minimal environmental impact while maintaining or improving product quality and economic viability.

### Cooking

In the context of sustainability, cooking refers to the methods and technologies used for food preparation, particularly in households. Sustainable cooking is particularly crucial in developing regions where traditional cooking methods often rely on biomass fuels, contributing to deforestation and health issues from indoor air pollution. Promoting clean and efficient cooking technologies can have significant environmental and health benefits in these areas.
