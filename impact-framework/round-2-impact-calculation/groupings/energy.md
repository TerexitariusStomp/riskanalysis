# Energy

### Solar

Solar power harnesses energy from sunlight and converts it into electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. PV panels directly convert sunlight into electricity using the photovoltaic effect, while CSP systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight, generating heat to drive steam turbines. Solar energy is a rapidly growing renewable source, with global capacity increasing significantly in recent years.

### Natural Gas

Natural gas is a fossil energy source formed deep beneath the Earth's surface. It's extracted through drilling, often using techniques like hydraulic fracturing for unconventional deposits. Natural gas is considered a cleaner alternative to coal for electricity generation, though it's not renewable. Processing natural gas involves removing impurities and separating various components to produce pipeline-quality dry gas.

### Waste Energy Recovery

Waste energy recovery, also known as Waste-to-Energy (WtE), involves converting non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel. This process helps reduce landfill waste while generating energy. Technologies like thermolysis can break down materials such as plastics, rubber, and organic waste at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen, producing fuel, charcoal, synthetic gas, and electricity.

### Hydroelectric

Hydroelectric power generates electricity by harnessing the potential energy of falling or fast-flowing water. In typical systems, water is collected at a higher elevation and directed through pipes to lower elevations, driving turbines connected to generators. Hydroelectric plants are often integrated into dams, using the difference in water levels (head) to maximize power generation.

### Wind

Wind energy converts the kinetic energy of moving air into electricity using wind turbines. Modern turbines have rotor blades that capture wind energy, converting it into rotational energy, which is then transferred to a generator. Wind power capacity has grown significantly worldwide, with both onshore and offshore installations increasing. Technological advancements have led to larger, more efficient turbines and reduced costs.

### Biomass

Biomass energy utilizes organic material from plants or animals as a fuel source. This can include wood and wood waste, crops, or animal manure. Biomass can be used directly as fuel or transformed into other energy forms like biofuel or biogas. The most common method is direct combustion in biomass boilers, but other conversion processes exist. Biomass is considered a renewable energy source, as the carbon emitted during burning is offset by the carbon absorbed by plants during growth.
