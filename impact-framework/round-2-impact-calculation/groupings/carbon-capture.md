# Carbon Capture

### Biochar

Biochar is an innovative approach to carbon sequestration and soil improvement. It is a type of charcoal produced by burning organic matter in a low-oxygen environment, a process known as pyrolysis. This method transforms biomass that would otherwise decompose and release carbon dioxide into a stable, carbon-rich material.

### Carbon Capture

Carbon capture refers to a range of technologies and processes designed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or prevent its release from point sources like power plants and industrial facilities. This approach is considered crucial for meeting global climate goals, especially in sectors where emissions are hard to eliminate.
