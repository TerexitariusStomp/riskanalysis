# Token Score

Some tokens have multiple projects that contribute to their value. For example The Base Carbon Tonne from Toucan is composed of 140 different projects from around the world. To unbundle the token the total amount is divided by how much each project contributes to that total.&#x20;

For each project the impact score is found. The % contribution of the project to the token is then multiplied by the impact score. After this is done for each project the total impact score is then divided by the number of projects that affected this score.&#x20;

(A\*E+C\*F+D\*G...)/N=Token Score

A through D represent each individual project

E Through G represent the amount each project contributes to the total score
