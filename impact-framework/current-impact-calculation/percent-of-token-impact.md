# Percent of Token Impact

How does your token's value reflect impact? This is the question we ask projects during our onboarding process. This is to get an estimation as to what % of the monetary value is directly related to the impact of the asset.&#x20;

For Example

Protocol- KlimaDAO

KlimaDAO's token value is backed by the amount of carbon credits the organization holds. As of 10/14/24 KlimaDAO holds around USD $251,458.535 of USD pegged tokens (A). The total treasury value of KlimaDAO is USD $13,724,447.20 (B) - so .018 of their token value is not related to impact  A/ B= 0.018

Asset- Toucan's BCT

Toucan's BCT is a tokenized carbon credit so 100% of their token's value is impact related.&#x20;
