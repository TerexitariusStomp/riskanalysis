# SDG Fulfillment

During impact onboarding and with publicly available information- how well a project fulfills the SDGs they touch upon is able to be gathered. This is a singular score for all SDGs.&#x20;

0 is the project does not touch upon the SDGs at all and none of the SDGs are fulfilled, 1 is all of the SDGs are fulfilled to the best possible extent they can be.&#x20;

Perplexity AI is used to intake the qualitative data and output a quantitative scoring.&#x20;
