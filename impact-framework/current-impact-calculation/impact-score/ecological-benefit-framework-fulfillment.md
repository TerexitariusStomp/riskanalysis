# Ecological Benefit Framework Fulfillment

During impact onboarding and with publicly available information- how well a project fulfills the Ecological Benefits they touch upon is able to be gathered. For each ecological benefit there is a score (air, water, soil, biodiversity, equity, carbon). All ecological benefits currently recieve the same weighting (air is not valued over equity, etc.).&#x20;

0 is the project does not contribute in any meaningful way to the ecological benefit and 1 is the project contributes to the maximum way possible to increasing the ecological benefit for all.&#x20;

Perplexity AI is used to intake the qualitative data and output a quantitative scoring.&#x20;
