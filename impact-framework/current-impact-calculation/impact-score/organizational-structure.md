# Organizational Structure

There are three different types of organizations in this scoring.&#x20;

Centralized- 1 or a few people are in control, are not easily replaceable and are not trying to distribute control.

Gradual Decentralized- The current organization is centralized but is moving towards decentralization.&#x20;

Decentralized- If the people that help steer the organization are taken out they would be easily replaced and the organization's actions would not noticeably change. &#x20;



Centralized is the least favoured and decentralized is the most.&#x20;
