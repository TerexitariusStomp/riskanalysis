# Low

* **Pros:**
  * **Broad Distribution:** A low ratio suggests that the token is more widely held, potentially indicating broad-based interest and adoption. This can be positive for the project's ecosystem as it implies a diverse and engaged community.
  * **Reduced Risk of Manipulation:** With a large number of holders, it becomes more difficult for any single entity to manipulate the token's price, leading to greater price stability.
* **Cons:**
  * **Lower Individual Commitment:** A low ratio might indicate that holders have less personal investment in the token's success, possibly leading to higher selling pressure during market downturns.
  * **Increased Volatility:** If many holders have small stakes, they might be more prone to sell during periods of uncertainty, potentially leading to increased price volatility.
