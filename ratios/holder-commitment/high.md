# High

* **Pros:**
  * **Strong Investor Confidence:** A high ratio indicates that the token is held by individuals or entities with substantial stakes, suggesting that they believe strongly in the token's future value. These holders are likely to be more engaged and committed to the project's success.
  * **Lower Selling Pressure:** Holders with significant investments are less likely to sell quickly, reducing short-term volatility and promoting long-term stability.
* **Cons:**
  * **Risk of Concentration:** If a small number of holders control a large portion of the market cap, the token might be susceptible to significant price swings if any of these major holders decide to sell.
  * **Limited Distribution:** A high conviction ratio could also indicate that the token is not widely distributed, which might limit its utility and adoption, potentially hindering the project's growth.
