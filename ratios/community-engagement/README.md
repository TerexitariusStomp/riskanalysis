# Community Engagement

* **Formula:**\
  `Engagement Ratio = Total Number of Messages Sent in Social Channels / Number of Holders`
* **Interpretation:**\
  This ratio reflects the average level of activity and communication generated by each token holder in social channels such as Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Reddit, or project-specific forums. A higher ratio indicates a more engaged and vocal community, while a lower ratio might suggest less active participation.
