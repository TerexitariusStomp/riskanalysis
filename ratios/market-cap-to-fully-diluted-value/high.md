# High

&#x20;**Market Cap Close to FDV (High Ratio, Close to 1)**



**Interpretation:**

* **Growth Potential:** Limited. Since most of the tokens are already in circulation, thereâ€™s less room for additional tokens to be distributed to the community. This situation might lead to less community engagement or fewer incentives for new participants to join unless the project can create new growth or issue more tokens.
* **Investor Perspective:** Caution might be warranted. The market might perceive that the token has already captured much of its potential value, leading to concerns about upside potential unless the project can justify a higher valuation through development or innovation.

**Price Volatility:**

* Projects with a high market cap to FDV ratio might experience less price volatility since most tokens are already in circulation. In contrast, projects with a low ratio might see more significant price swings as new tokens are introduced to the market.
