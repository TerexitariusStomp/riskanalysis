# Low

**Market Cap Far Below FDV (Low Ratio, Closer to 0)**



I**nterpretation:**

* **Growth Potential:** High. With a large portion of tokens still to be distributed, there is significant potential for the community to grow and for new participants to receive tokens through staking, rewards, or other mechanisms. This can lead to stronger community engagement and long-term support as people are incentivized to hold and participate in the ecosystem.
* **Investor Perspective:** This scenario might indicate strong conviction in the projectâ€™s future value. Investors might be betting on the project's potential and the value that the remaining token distribution can create, expecting the market cap to eventually catch up to the FDV as the project matures.

Additional Considerations

**Distribution Models:**

* In a low ratio scenario, the method of distributing the remaining tokens becomes critical. Fair and transparent distribution can foster trust and long-term growth. Conversely, if tokens are released too quickly or unfairly, it can lead to dilution and decreased value for existing holders.
