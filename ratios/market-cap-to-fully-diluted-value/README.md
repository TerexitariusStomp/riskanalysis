# Market Cap to Fully Diluted Value

This ratio indicates how much of the total token supply is already in circulation relative to the project’s full potential valuation.

* **Formula:** `Market Cap/FDV = (Current Price × Circulating Supply) / (Current Price × Total Supply) = Circulating Supply / Total Supply`
