# Holding Time Score

The "Holding Time Score" formula is designed to assess how long different percentages of people hold a token before they sell or move it, giving more weight to those who hold the token for longer periods. Here's how the formula works:

Holding Time **Score= (A\*H+B\*H+C\*H+D\*H+E\*H+F\*H/6)\*.01**

**Where**&#x20;

**A is Percent of People That Hold For Less Than 24 Hours**

**B is Percent of People that Hold for More than 24 hours and Less than 1 week**

**C is Percent of People that Hold for More than 1 Week and Less Than 30 Days**

**D is Percent of People that Hold for More Than 30 Days and Less than 90 Days**&#x20;

**E is Percent of People that Hold for More Than 90 Days and Less than 180 Days**

**F Percent of People that Hold for More Than 180 Days**

**H Is Number of Hours In Time Period (Giving A Higher Weight to Those That Hold Longer)**

**.01 is Applied to Bring Percent Score into Decimal**

This approach helps to identify whether a token has short-term traders or long-term holders, which is critical when assessing the tokenâ€™s stability as collateral for a stablecoin. A higher score reflects a larger portion of long-term holders, which generally indicates more stability and less price volatility, making it a potentially better choice for collateral.
