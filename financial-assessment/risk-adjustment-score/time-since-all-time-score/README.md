# Time Since All Time Score

The "Time Since All Time Score" is a metric that combines the "All Time High Score" and the "All Time Low Score" to give a measure of how the token has performed in relation to its historical price extremes. It considers both how long ago the token hit its all-time high and how long it has been since it reached its all-time low.

Time Since All Time Score=A\*B

Where

A is the All Time HIgh Score

B is the All Time Low Score

A **higher score** generally indicates that it has been a significant amount of time since the token hit either its all-time high or low. This can suggest that the token is more stable and less prone to extreme volatility in recent times, which could be a positive sign for stability as collateral.

A **lower score** indicates that the token has recently hit either its all-time high or low (or both), suggesting it may still be experiencing volatility or uncertainty in its price, which could represent a higher risk.
