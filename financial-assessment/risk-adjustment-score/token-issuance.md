# Token Issuance

The "Inflation Impact Score" is a metric designed to evaluate the impact of a token's annual inflation rate on its total supply. This score helps gauge how the token's value might be diluted over time due to new token issuance, which is important for assessing the token's long-term stability and suitability as an investment or collateral.

The Inflation Impact Score is determined through the following equation:

Inflation Impact Score = A / B

Where&#x20;

A is the Total Token Supply&#x20;

B is the Annual Token Issuance

Higher Inflation Impact Score: Indicates that the token has a lower inflation rate relative to its total supply. This suggests that the token's value is less likely to be diluted over time due to new issuance, which is favorable for long-term holding and use as collateral.

Lower Inflation Impact Score: Indicates that the annual token issuance is high relative to the total supply, which could suggest potential value dilution over time and a higher risk of price depreciation. This makes the token less ideal for long-term investment or use as collateral.
