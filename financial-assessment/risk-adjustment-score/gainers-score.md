# Gainers Score

The "Gainers Score" is a metric that measures the proportion of token holders who are currently "in the money" (profitable) compared to those who are "not in the money" (holding at a loss). This score provides insight into the financial health of the token holders and helps assess the token's overall market sentiment, which can be relevant when evaluating it as collateral.

Gainers Score= A-B/100

Where&#x20;

A is In Money

B is Not in Money

100 is Applied to Turn to Decimal

A **positive Gainers Score** (closer to 1) indicates that a larger proportion of holders are in profit, suggesting that the token is performing well in the market. This could imply strong market sentiment and lower risk, making the token more attractive as collateral.

A **negative Gainers Score** (closer to -1) suggests that more holders are at a loss, which might reflect weaker market performance and higher risk, potentially making the token less suitable for use as collateral.
