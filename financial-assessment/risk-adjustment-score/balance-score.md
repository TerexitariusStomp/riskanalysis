# Balance Score

The "Balance Score" is a metric designed to assess how evenly a token is distributed among its holders, with more weight given to tokens held in smaller amounts. This score helps evaluate whether the token has a broad, decentralized base of holders or if it is concentrated in a few large accounts, which can impact the tokenâ€™s suitability as collateral.

Balance **Score= 100/(A\*H+B\*H+C\*H+D\*H+E\*H+F\*H/6)\***

**Where**&#x20;

**A is Number of People That Hold Less Than 10k**

**B is Number of People that Hold More than 10k and Less Than 50k**

**C is Number of People that Hold More than 50k and Less Than 100k**

**D is Number of People that Hold More Than 100k and Less than 250k**&#x20;

**E is Number of People that Hold for More Than 250k and Less than 500k**

**F Number of People that Hold More Than 500k**

**H Is a Multiplier (Giving A Higher Weight to The Amount of People That Hold Less)**

**100 is Applied to Bring into Decimal**

A **higher Balance Score** suggests a more decentralized distribution of tokens, with a larger number of people holding smaller amounts. This is often a positive sign for stability, as it reduces the risk of large holders moving the market.

A **lower Balance Score** indicates a concentration of tokens in a few large accounts, which can lead to instability or manipulation, making the token less ideal for use as collateral in a stablecoin.
