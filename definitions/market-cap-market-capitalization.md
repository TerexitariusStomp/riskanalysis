# Market Cap (Market Capitalization)

This is the current value of all tokens that are actively circulating in the market. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of the token by the number of tokens currently in circulation.

* **Formula:** `Market Cap = Current Price × Circulating Supply`



1. **Price Volatility:**
   * Projects with a high market cap to FDV ratio might experience less price volatility since most tokens are already in circulation. In contrast, projects with a low ratio might see more significant price swings as new tokens are introduced to the market.
